The source code in this package are to show how to properly perform
unit testing using JUnit. Use them as an example of how to write your own
tests.

http://www.vogella.de/articles/JUnit/article.html is a good tutorial
on using JUnit and was used as a guide for creating this sample package.

The tests should be separate from the source. So there is a "tests" directory
containing all the tests.
