The package org.setiquest.samples.JSON provides an example of how to 
use the Jackson package to read and write JSON packages.

The Person.java class is used as the example class  for reading and writing from/to
JSON. There is a test for the Person class in tests/org.setiquest.samples.JUnit.

The JSONExample.java illustrates how to use JSON and Jackson to turn a 
class instance into an ASCII JSON object, and back to a class instance.
